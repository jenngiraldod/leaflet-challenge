### Background
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

### Project Overview
This project utilizes Leaflet.js and D3.js to create an interactive web map that visualizes earthquake data. The map dynamically loads earthquake information and represents it with color-coded markers based on magnitude. It features multiple map layers, real-time data fetching, and an intuitive legend for better data interpretation. This project demonstrates the power of web-based geospatial visualization and interactive data representation.
