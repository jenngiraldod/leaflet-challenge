# leaflet-challenge
### Project Overview
This project utilizes Leaflet.js and D3.js to create an interactive web map that visualizes earthquake data. The map dynamically loads earthquake information and represents it with color-coded markers based on magnitude. It features multiple map layers, real-time data fetching, and an intuitive legend for better data interpretation. This project demonstrates the power of web-based geospatial visualization and interactive data representation.
